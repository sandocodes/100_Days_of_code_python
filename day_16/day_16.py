"""
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Two things to keep in mind when it comes to objects in OOP:
    1. What the object has (attributes)
    2. What the object does (methods)

    Example: waiter at a restaurant:
        Attributes: hold plates, responsible for tables, ect.
        Methods: take orders, take payments, etc.
